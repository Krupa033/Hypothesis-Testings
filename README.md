Hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical technique used to make informed decisions based on sample data. 
It allows us to assess whether observed differences or effects are statistically significant or merely due to random chance. 
In this project, we delve into various aspects of hypothesis testing, including p-values, significance levels, types of errors, one-tailed tests, and two-tailed tests.
Our goal is to Define the context and provide a clear statement of what you aim to explore through hypothesis testing.
